## üèõÔ∏è Component Architecture Overview

### Core Components
- **Layout Components**
  - `Header.jsx`: Main navigation with responsive menu
  - `Footer.jsx`: Site footer with contact information
  - `MainPage.jsx`: Main layout wrapper and navigation controller

- **Page Components**
  - Sequential page components (FirstPage through EighthPage)
  - Each page follows a consistent structure with:
    - Main heading
    - Section content
    - Navigation controls
    - Interactive elements

- **Feature Components**
  - `GetInTouch.jsx`: Contact form with Firebase integration
  - `PerformanceSection.jsx`: Performance metrics display

### State Management
- Local component state using React hooks
- Firebase for form data persistence
- Context API for global state management

## üì± Responsive Design Strategy

### Breakpoints
